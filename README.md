# Algorithms Library

Here will be stored the collection of most known algorithms such as

1. Graph algorithms
2. Dynamic programming
3. Searching and Sorting
4. Number theory and Other Mathematical
5. Geometrical and Network Flow Algorithms
6. Data Structures

Also here will be implemented unit tests for each algorithm.

### Currently implemented
#### Searching and Sorting:
- insertion sort;
